# Hello World!

Oh wow! Another blog is born! Time to accumulate an army of eager and avid readers, and rise to a celebrity status like no other! 🚀🎸🤘🏻

Oooorrrr maybe it'll die after 2.5 posts, like every other blog on the internet.

Who knows!

Honestly, I admit I'm probably halfway there, as this post is mostly being used as a test for my [homebrewed blog framework](https://github.com/JCGrant/blog/). But, I guess it also serves as a brief 'hello' to the internet as a whole...

So, hey there!

It's funny because this post was originally just filled with [Lorem Ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum). But after writing my [second post](?p=2021/07/01/how-did-i-create-this-blog) (on how I wrote my own blog framework), I actually started getting into this whole writing thing. I've heard that blogging is a pretty cool way to organise one's thoughts while coding, so maybe I'll give this a try.

Or maybe not.

Not gonna promise anything!
